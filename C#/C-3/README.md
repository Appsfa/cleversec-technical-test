# Challenge 3

Complete the following program which takes number as a input and prints the
Fibonacci series up to that range.

> Help: Fibonacci series
Numbers of fibonacci sequence are known as fibonacci numbers. First few numbers of series are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 etc, Except first two terms in sequence every other term is the sum of two previous terms, For example 8 = 3 + 5 (addition of 3, 5). This sequence has many applications in mathematics and Computer Science.

**Your program should be exactly similar like given below:**

## Example 1:

Enter the number of terms: `5`

First terms of fibonacci series are :
```
0
1
1
2
3
```

## Example 2:

Enter the number of terms: `8`

First terms of fibonacci series are :
```
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
```
